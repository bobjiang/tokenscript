## Public Participation Invited

TokenScript is part of the EEA Community Projects and welcomes participation by anyone. Substantive contributions and feedbacks are invited from all parties, following the common conventions for participation in GitHub public repository projects.

Participation is expected to be consistent with our [OASIS Participants Code of Conduct](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-participants-code-of-conduct/), the licenses applicable for each repository, and the acceptance of our individual [Contributor License Agreement](https://www.oasis-open.org/open-projects/cla/oasis-open-projects-individual-contributor-license-agreement-i-cla/), generally at the time of first contribution.

### About the CLA Bot

When you first submit a pull request, CLA Assistant, a bot, will check to see whether you have previously signed the [Individual CLA](https://cla-assistant.io/eea-oasis/managed-open-project). If you have already done so, this check will pass. If not, the bot will comment on the PR with a link and instruction for you to click and sign the CLA electronically via GitHub. If you use different GitHub accounts for work and personal use, please make sure you are signed in to the correct account.
