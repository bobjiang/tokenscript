## TokenScript: Add Rich Functionality To Your Tokens

**Bring context, security and cross-platform functionality (iOS, Android and Web) to your favourite tokens with a single file.**

## Badges

Using badges is optional, but they are a nice way to show some key facts and stats about your project at a glance. There are badges for all kinds of things relating to your repository, e.g. to show the license you're using, the programming language, the number of forks, or a CI badge to show build/test status. Be mindful not to use too many badges. You can use [Shields](http://shields.io/) to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge. Check out the README of the Open Cybersecurity Alliance project [Kestrel](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/kestrel-lang) to see badges in action.

## Introduction

TokenScript makes Smart Token (Credit to [Virgil Griffith](https://twitter.com/virgilgr) for coming up with the term). These are like traditional ERC20 or ERC721 tokens, but with extendable structure & signed JavaScript to realise rich functions and full composability that DApps struggle to implement, and be traded with flexible, customisable trading rules.

A TokenScript file is made of
- JavaScript to make Token work in the user's wallet or across multiple apps; and
- XML data to extract status and value of the token.

In short, it's like a secure front-end for tokens.

**Benefits**
-   Run your tokens from users wallets as native, modular â€˜Mini-DApps'
-   Extend token structure and realise rich functions with a single file
-   Portable across DApps
-   Sync updates at any time
-   Blockchain agnostic
-   Secure Enclave
-   DvP Security
-   Context based programming: User-experience
-   Attestation

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

If applicable, list here what is need to install the software and how to install them. Also list any dependencies, if applicable.


### Installation

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## How to run tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With
